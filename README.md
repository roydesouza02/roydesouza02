- 👋 Hi, I’m @roydesouza02, the Chief Purr-ogrammer of the Meow-niverse!
- 👀 I’m interested in chasing laser pointers, knocking over code (and mugs), and scratching out bugs in the litter-box of life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to paw-sitively master the art of napping on keyboards while still committing to Git.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve catnip-driven development and whisker-optimized algorithms.
- 📫 How to reach me: Drop a can of tuna at my inbox or send a carrier pigeon with a bell (I’ll chase it).
- 😄 Pronouns: Meow/Mew
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once debugged a program by sleeping on the Enter key—purr-fect execution every time!
